# Maths App

This is an app I built so I can implement what I learnt about storing the functions that handle our state in a ViewModel class.
The app features;
-  A Card composable that displays random arithmetic sum of 3 numbers.
-  A Text Field where the user enters their answer
-  A Submit and Skip button

Some functionalities of the app are the following; 
a user cannot submit an empty Text Field, the Text Field highlights in red to notify the user to either click the skip button to go to the next randomly generated arithmetic expression or fill in their answer.

another randomly generated arithmetic expression is shown when the user clicks the skip button.


here are some screenshots of the app
